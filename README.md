# Express.js Async Database Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a potential uncommon error scenario in Express.js applications involving asynchronous database operations and unhandled promise rejections.  The bug showcases a situation where a database query failure isn't explicitly handled, leading to unexpected application behavior.

## Bug Description
The primary issue lies in the lack of robust error handling for asynchronous database operations.  If the database query fails (e.g., due to a network problem or database outage), a promise rejection might occur without being caught, potentially crashing the server silently.  This is an uncommon error because it often depends on the specific timing and concurrency of requests and database interactions.

## Solution
The solution involves proper `try...catch` blocks around database operations (for synchronous code) or utilizing `.catch()` methods on promises (for asynchronous code) to handle potential errors gracefully.  This prevents application crashes and allows for sending appropriate error responses to the client.
