const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // ... some database operation to fetch user data ...
  if (!userData) {
    return res.status(404).send('User not found');
  }
  res.send(userData);
});

//Problem: The above code is vulnerable to a common error where if the database operation fails (e.g., due to a network error or database outage), the code will not handle that scenario and will potentially crash the application or send an unexpected error message to the client.

//Uncommon Error Scenario:
//In some database operation, if there is an asynchronous operation to fetch the user data and an error occurs during the fetch, there is a possibility of unhandled promise rejections causing the server to crash silently or behave unpredictably.  This is an uncommon error because it's not immediately apparent from a simple synchronous code example. The problem manifests only under specific concurrent execution circumstances.
